            <p>Alpha Kappa Psi has had a lot of professional 
                events this passed summer and during the semester so far.
                Over the summer, two of our brothers attending the AKPsi Convention
                in Miami, Florida. These brothers, Caitlyn Marsh and Zach Evans, voted
                on legislature, sat in on important brotherhood meetings, connected
                with alumni, and attended social events to bond with brothers. This fall
                semester has been a busy one with numerous professional events already in 
                effect. Last week, TTI came and sproke to the brothers at the house about
                opportunities within the company. This upcoming week, Ratheon is hosting a 
                virtual meeting for brothers to learn about their company. After this event, 
                a few other business fratnertities collaborated with AKPsi to have a career fair,
                bringing in numerous new companies, giving all our brothers access to professional
                opportunities. More professional events are in the works so stay tuned for more 
                blog posts!

            <p>On top of all things professional, Aplha Kappa Psi hosts social events
                for the brothers to enjoy. This past week, we had Big Little Night to celebrate 
                our new family pairings. The Bigs unveiled who they were to the New Members, they 
                were all so excited and happy! After this, we celebrated with family traditions and 
                brotherhood bonding. The next night, one of our families put on a comedy night, a suprise
                for the brotherhood. Friends acted skits and a few brothers even did stand up. Many laughs 
                were had and smiles were on everyones faces. This weekend at MSU was homecoming! We hosted an
                event at the house to celebrate all of our brothers coming back to campus. We connected with 
                alumni new brothers had not met yet and reconnected with alumni we have know for years! This 
                was an amazing time for everyone, we were happy to see familiar faces on campus again. Look 
                out for next weeks blog post on more social events!
