            <h2>Professional Events Happening within the Fraternity </h2>
            <p>Alpha Kappa Psi has had a lot of professional 
                events this passed summer and during the semester so far.
                Over the summer, two of our brothers attending the AKPsi Convention
                in Miami, Florida. These brothers, Caitlyn Marsh and Zach Evans, voted
                on legislature, sat in on important brotherhood meetings, connected
                with alumni, and attended social events to bond with brothers. This fall
                semester has been a busy one with numerous professional events already in 
                effect. Last week, TTI came and sproke to the brothers at the house about
                opportunities within the company. This upcoming week, Ratheon is hosting a 
                virtual meeting for brothers to learn about their company. After this event, 
                a few other business fratnertities collaborated with AKPsi to have a career fair,
                bringing in numerous new companies, giving all our brothers access to professional
                opportunities. More professional events are in the works so stay tuned for more 
                blog posts!

                brotherhood bonding. The next night, one of our families put on a comedy night, a suprise
                for the brotherhood. Friends acted skits and a few brothers even did stand up. Many laughs 
                were had and smiles were on everyones faces. This weekend at MSU was homecoming! We hosted an
